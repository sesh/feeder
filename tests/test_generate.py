JSON is simpler to read and write, and it’s less prone to bugs.</p>\n\n<p>So we developed JSON Feed, a format similar to <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom</a> but in JSON. It reflects the lessons learned from our years of work reading and publishing feeds.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://jsonfeed.org/version/1">See the spec</a>. It’s at version 1, which may be the only version ever needed. If future versions are needed, version 1 feeds will still be valid feeds.</p>\n\n<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>\n\n<p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/manton/jsonfeed-wp">WordPress plugin</a> and, coming soon, a JSON Feed Parser for Swift. As more code is written, by us and others, we’ll update the <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/code">code</a> page.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/mappingrssandatom">Mapping RSS and Atom to JSON Feed</a> for more on the similarities between the formats.</p>\n\n<p>This website —\xa0the Markdown files and supporting resources —\xa0<a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed">is up on GitHub</a>, and you’re welcome to comment there.</p>\n\n<p>This website is also a blog, and you can subscribe to the <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/xml/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> or the <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/feed.json">JSON feed</a> (if your reader supports it).</p>\n\n<p>We worked with a number of people on this over the course of several months. We list them, and thank them, at the bottom of the <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/version/1">spec</a>. But — most importantly — <a href="http://furbo.org/">Craig Hockenberry</a> spent a little time making it look pretty. :)</p>\n',  # noqa
